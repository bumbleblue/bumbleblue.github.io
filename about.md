I work in civic tech and advocacy. I explore ways to make a difference with science and tech (and funding). I enjoy telling people about all things open.

I'm part of the team behind [Code for Germany](http://codefor.de/) and [Prototype Fund](http://prototypefund.de/). My focus is on communications and content, and on international exchange.

I studied Philosophy at [Trinity College, Cambridge](http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/) and Logic at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl/) in Amsterdam.

I am originally from Berlin, where I attended the [John F. Kennedy School](http://jfks.de/).

I love Duke Ellington &#38; Billy Strayhorn. I hate raisins.

I don't always start each paragraph with 'I'.
