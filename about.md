Hi, I'm Eileen. I am a logician turned technologist. I like breaking things down, juggling ideas, and writing up my thoughts in flow charts. I read documentations as a hobby, and I am a compulsive list maker. I believe that openness matters.

Until recently, I was part of the team behind [Code for Germany](http://codefor.de/) and [Prototype Fund](http://prototypefund.de/). We explore ways to make a difference with technology, especially with funding for open source projects. My focus was on communications and content.

I studied Philosophy at [Trinity College, Cambridge](http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/) and Logic at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl/) in Amsterdam. I contribute to the [Open Logic Project](http://openlogicproject.org/).

I am originally from Berlin, where I attended the [John F. Kennedy School](http://jfks.de/).

I love Duke Ellington &#38; Billy Strayhorn. I hate raisins.
