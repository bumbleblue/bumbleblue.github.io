"It ain't necessarily so..." is one of the most memorable songs from the Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess. Apart from raising serious doubts about the stories one finds in the Bible, I think it also provides an excellent title for this brand-new, super-fresh, and certainly mind-blowing blog on philosophy and living with philosophy. As to the form and content of this blog: I havenâ€™t a clue. I will simply let it live for a while and see where it takes me. If all things fail, sudokus shall be published on a weekly basis.
