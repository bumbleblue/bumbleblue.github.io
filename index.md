I am Content Manager at [Code for Germany](http://codefor.de/) and [Open Budgets EU](http://openbudgets.eu/). I enjoy telling people about all things open.

I studied philosophy at [Trinity College, Cambridge](http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/) and logic at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl/) in Amsterdam.

I am originally from Berlin, where I attended the [John F. Kennedy School](http://jfks.de/).

Here is my site at [Academia.edu](https://amsterdam.academia.edu/EileenWagner/). You can find me on [Ello](https://ello.co/bumbleblue). I also [tweet](https://twitter.com/flapperleenie).
