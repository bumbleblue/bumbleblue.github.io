Open resources
: Simply Secure has a [knowledge base](https://simplysecure.org/knowledge-base/) for building skills in privacy, security, and transparency. These practical guides written for busy practitioners range from basics requiring no prior knowledge to technical discussion of the latest developments.

Open knowledge
: The [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.de) develops and implements digital tools to empower citizens. Their issues range from open data and civic tech to transparency and digital literacy.

Open-ended hierarchies
: If plural logic is awesome, then superplural logic must be super awesome. More about cheerios, innocence and open-ended hierarchies in my master's thesis, [Superplural Logic](https://www.illc.uva.nl/Research/Publications/Reports/MoL-2015-23.text.pdf).

Open access
: Scientific data and ideas should be free and accessible to all. Here's Wittgenstein's [Nachlass](http://www.wittgensteinsource.org), published and curated by the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen.

Open relationships
: If you heard me talk about it, I most likely recommended Carrie & Jonathan Ichikawa Jenkins's article [(PDF)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cgaw1sxphy1zev4/On%20Being%20The%20Only%20Ones.pdf?dl=0)
 to you.

Open rehearsals
: You like singing, close harmony, and sappy old love songs? Oh wow. I guess you should join your local barbershop community. Berliners, why not check out the [Women in Black](http://womeninblack.de/).
