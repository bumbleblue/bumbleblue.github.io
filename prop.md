Open-ended hierarchies
: If plural logic is awesome, then superplural logic must be super awesome. More about cheerios, innocence and open-ended hierarchies in my master's thesis, [Superplural Logic](https://www.illc.uva.nl/Research/Publications/Reports/MoL-2015-23.text.pdf).

Open access
: Scientific data and ideas should be free and accessible to all. Here's Wittgenstein's [Nachlass](http://www.wittgensteinsource.org), published and curated by the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen.

Open relationships
: If you heard me talk about it, I most likely recommended Carrie & Jonathan Ichikawa Jenkins's article [(PDF)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cgaw1sxphy1zev4/On%20Being%20The%20Only%20Ones.pdf?dl=0)
 to you.

Open rehearsals

Open table
: I run a [stammtisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stammtisch) in Berlin. Join our [mailing list](https://lists.posteo.de/listinfo/schlammtisch) to attend!
